I am a PhD student in the [Mathematical Statistics Research Group](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/statistics) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) supervised by [Mathias Drton](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/people/professors/drton-mathias/). My current research focuses on <b> Causal Inference </b> with <b> Graphical Models</b>. In particular, how to quantify remaining uncertainty for estimates of causal effects (effects of interventions) in complex systems when the causal structure itself is learned from data. I am part of the ERC project Graphical Models for Complex Multivariate Data and member of the Munich Center for Machine Learning [(MCML)](https://mcml.ai/).

Before that, I obtained my M. Sc. and B. Sc. degree in Mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) under supervision of Norbert Henze, Bruno Ebner and Bernhard Klar.
