I am a PhD student in the [Statistics Research Group](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/research/groups/statistics) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) supervised by [Mathias Drton](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/people/professors/drton-mathias/). My primary research interests lie in graphicaal modeling in the context of causal inference. In particular, my current research focuses on quantifying uncertainty when estimating the effect of interventions in complex systems with unknown causal structure. I am part of the ERC project Graphical Models for Complex Multivariate Data and member of the Munich Center for Machine Learning [(MCML)](https://mcml.ai/).

Before that I obtained my M. Sc. and B. Sc. degree in Mathematics at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) under supervision of Norbert Henze, Bruno Ebner and Bernhard Klar.
